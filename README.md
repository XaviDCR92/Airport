#Airport

##Overview

###What is Airport?

Airport is an open-source video game for the original Sony Playstation aka PSX/PS1. The player puts himself/herself in the role of an Air Traffic Controller (ATC), where lots of inbound/outbund flights need to be controlled without delays.

###What is Airport written with?

Airport is written using an open-source SDK called PSXSDK together with the GNU toolchain. PSXSDK can be freely [here](http://unhaut.x10host.com/psxsdk/ "PSXSDK official link"). However, a fork was created specifically from the 20150729 version with new experimental features and posted into [Github](https://github.com/XaviDCR92/psxsdk-20150729 "PSXSDK-20150729 fork").
